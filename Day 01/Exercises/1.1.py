#Instructions
#Write a program in main.py that prints the same notes from the previous lesson using what you have learnt about the Python print function.

#Warning: The output in your program should match the example output shown below exactly, character for character, even spaces and symbols should be identical, otherwise the tests won't pass.

#Example Output
#After you have written your code, you should run your program and it should print the following:

![1 1  print](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/122369882/213155680-7b22083f-5046-43e5-a3bd-12f7286639fa.gif)

#Write your code below this line ðŸ‘‡

print("Day 1 - Python Print Function")
print("The function is declared like this:")
print("print('what to print')")
